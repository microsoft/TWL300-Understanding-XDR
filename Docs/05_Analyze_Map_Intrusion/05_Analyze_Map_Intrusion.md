### **Exercise Learning Objectives**
- Detect and trace a Business Email Compromise (BEC) path starting with a Safe Links bypass and malicious attachment in Defender for Office 365 (MDO).

- Enrich the story across email, identity, device, and cloud apps using Advanced Hunting and MDA signals.  
- Map observed behaviors to MITRE ATT&CK techniques and document gaps and mitigations.  

### **Licensing and Environment** 

- An active Microsoft 365 tenant with security.microsoft.com access.
