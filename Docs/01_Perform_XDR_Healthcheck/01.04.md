## Task 04: Verify data ingestion from XDR sources using KQL queries

1. In the leftmost pane, select **Investigation & response** > **Hunting** > **Advanced hunting**.  

    {: .note }
    > In the following steps, copy/paste the provided query file contents from the code blocks into the query editor. After pasting, **highlight the entire query by selecting Ctrl+A**, then select **Run query** to review the results.  

    {: .warning }
    > You'll run into an error if you don't highlight the entire query, as it will try to run just one block of the query by default.
    >
    > ![3xd2n93q.jpg](../../media/3xd2n93q.jpg)

1. Copy and paste the **01-IngestionPulse.txt** content below in the Query Window, highlight the entire query by selecting **Ctrl+A**, then select **Run Query** to view the result.

    {: .note }
    > Ingestion pulse (counts per source in last 24h): Tallies event volumes from the demo Endpoint, Email, Identity, and CloudApp datasets in the last 24 hours to confirm data is flowing.

    {: .note }
    > This data does not actually come from any existing assets (emails, endpoints, cloud apps, identities) within the Microsoft Defender portal.  It is artificially generated to give us data to work with in the lab.

    {: .warning }
    > Selecting the **Copy** option in the upper-right corner of the code block and pasting with **Ctrl+V** will be significantly faster than selecting **Type**!
